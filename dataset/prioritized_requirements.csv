Note: The component diagram shows the different components involved in restricting access to the system. The `RegisteredRealtor` and `UnregisteredRealtor` actors interact with the `UserInterface`, which then communicates with the `AuthenticationModule`. The `AuthenticationModule` checks the user's credentials and then interacts with the `AuthorizationModule` to determine if the user is a registered realtor. If authorized, the `SystemAccessModule` grants access to the system. The `RealtorRegistrationModule` is used to register new realtors, which then updates the `AuthenticationModule` with the new user's information.","@startuml
